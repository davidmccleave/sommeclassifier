Sommeclassifier: Wine Recommender System
==========================================

The world of wine entices many but confuses most. How does one decide which variety of wine to buy for the flavours they seek, 
or which wine will pair best with the meal they're preparing for friends and family? A recommender system
is proposed that will recommend a selection of wine varieties that best match a description given in natural language.
The recommender system is a content-based recommendation system that's suggestions are generated by a trained naive
Bayes classifier.

Use Cases:
-------------

1. Deciding on a wine that promises the flavours you are interested in tasting at a dinner.
2. Looking for similiar wines to the descriptions given by a real sommelier.
3. Learning more about how wines are described.

How to run locally:
-------------------

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd` into the ``website/`` directory.
3. Execute ``flask run`` from the command-line.
4. Visit the shown local address (typically, ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``) where the site will be hosted locally.
