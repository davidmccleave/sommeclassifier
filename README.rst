Data Science Project 3: Recommender System
==========================================

This repository contains a couple directories:

- `data/`
- `src/`

`data/` contains all the csv files used in the project. 

`src/` contains the code itself in a Jupyter Notebook, `code.ipynb`,
and the dependencies that must be installed to run the code in the file `requirements.txt`.

Brief Summary
-------------
The world of wine entices many but confuses most. How does one decide which variety of wine to buy for the flavours they seek, 
or which wine will pair best with the meal they're preparing for friends and family? A recommender system
is proposed that will recommend a selection of wine varieties that best match a description given in natural language.
The recommender system is a content-based recommendation system that's suggestions are generated by a trained naive
Bayes classifier.
